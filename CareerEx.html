      <h1>Career Exploration...</h1>
      <p>During my time in high school, I explored careers that interest me through my Engineering design and Robotics club. The research I have done for my career option is reading articles- about the steps for becoming an IoT engineer and the degrees required for the position. I look into companies like aerospace or software and how they utilize IoT. The final thing I have researched is about some good colleges and universities that make me one more step ahead of my goal of becoming an IoT engineer.</p> 
<p>I also get inspiration from many successful people in our world, such as Elon Musk, Sundar Pichai, and much more, and try to prepare for competitions such as AMC and Olympiads to be accepted into a good university, thus helping me to reach my dream career. What I have learned from my research is that IoT Engineers are highly respected and intelligent- they solve problems. They're in demand because IoT is involved in every type of system. This information influences my career choice- because I want to aim high and achieve as much as possible, just like how these brilliant people achieved.
